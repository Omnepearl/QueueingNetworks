## Introduction

Pearl--add a nice intro? "we assume previous knowledge of queueing networks yada yada yada"

## Measures of System Performance

Variable | Definition
------------- | -------------
$\lambda$  | Average arrival rate
$S$  | Random service rate
$\mu$  | Average service rate
$c$  | Number of servers
$r = \lambda / \mu$  | Offered load
$\rho = \lambda / c \mu$  | Traffic intensity or utilization
$T, T_{q}$  | Random time a customer spends in the system / queue
$W, W_{q}$  | Average time a customer spends in the system / queue
$N, N_{q}$  | Random number of customers in the system / queue
$L, L_{q}$  | Average number of customers in the system / queue

## Notation and relationships for G/G/1 queue

In event-oriented bookkeeping, the system state is only updated when events occur. Either when customers/jobs arrive or depart. Suppose we observe a system, recording the times of arrival and service for each entity. An alternative to recording arrival times is to record the time between arrivals. With this information we can calculate measures of effectiveness (see table above) and find other bookkeeping results such as:

Variable | Definition | Sample relationship
------------- | ------------- | -------------
$A^{(n)}$  | Arrival time of cust. $n$ | 
$S^{(n)}$  | Service time of cust. $n$ |
$T^{(n)}$  | Interarrival time cust. $n$ and $n+1$ | $T^{(n)} = A^{(n+1)} - A^{(n)}$
$U^{(n)}$  | Time cust. $n$ starts service | $U^{(n+1)} = max\{D^{(n)}, A^{(n+1)}\}$
$D^{(n)}$  |Departure time of cust. $n$ | $D^{(n)} = U^{(n)} + S^{(n)}$
$W_{q}^{(n)}$  | Time in queue of cust. $n$ | $W_{q}^{(n)} = U^{(n)} - A^{(n)}$
$W^{(n)}$  | Time in system of cust. $n$ | $W^{(n)} = W_{q}^{(n)} + S^{(n)}$

The analysis is obtained under the assumption of a single server with FCFS discipline. No assumptions are required on the probability laws for the interarrival times or service times.
